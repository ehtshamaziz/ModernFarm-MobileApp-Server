# Node.js/Express.js Starter

This is a simple starter template for building Node.js and Express.js applications. It includes a basic project structure with controllers, models, routes, and middleware for setting up your Node.js/Express.js projects quickly.

## Features

- **Database Connection**: It comes preconfigured with Mongoose for MongoDB database connectivity.
- **Middleware**: Includes essential middleware like Helmet for security headers, CORS for handling cross-origin requests, and Morgan for request logging.
- **Error Handling**: Provides global error handling middleware to catch and handle errors with appropriate responses.
- **Routing**: Demonstrates how to set up routes using Express Router.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Authentication**: Shows an example of JWT-based authentication using middleware.
- **Sample Routes & Controllers**Sample routes and controllers for creating, updating, deleting, and fetching data.
- **Google OAuth Setup (Optional)**"Optional Google OAuth setup for social authentication (commented out by default).
  
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed (at least version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager installed
- MongoDB (or an alternative database) set up with a connection URL

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
    git clone https://github.com/Humza1011/nodejs-starter.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:


    ```
    MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1/your-database-name
    JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

The server should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.js`: Main application file.
- `routes/`: Contains route definitions for different API endpoints.
- `controllers/`: Includes controller functions to handle route logic.
- `models/`: Defines data models using Mongoose.
- `middleware/`: Contains custom middleware functions.
- `README.md`: This file providing project information and setup instructions.
- `package.json`: Dependency and project metadata.

## Usage

You can use this starter template as a foundation for building your Node.js/Express.js applications. Customize and extend it based on your project requirements.
